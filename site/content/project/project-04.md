One of the most memorable events I’ve had the pleasure of producing was a holiday celebration for Salesforce employees and their guests at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco. The event welcomed around 1,500 people and extended across the entire museum—and even spilled out over a full city block. The theme was a vibrant, immersive Pan-Asian experience, with a Bollywood-inspired tent serving as the centerpiece.

We brought together 63 performers and artists to help bring the space to life. The result was a night filled with energy, culture, movement, and color—an unforgettable evening for everyone who attended.

## A Cultural Tapestry in Motion

Throughout the evening, guests explored a dynamic landscape of performance and interaction. Chinese dancers performed both traditional and fusion styles, while a Thai group offered a variety of elegant dances. Korean fan dancers brought grace and precision, and Japanese geishas shared a glimpse of older, more traditional performance art.

The Bollywood tent was high energy and full of life—colorful costumes, nonstop dance, and top South Asian DJs kept it buzzing. Mongolian contortionists, acrobats, and circus-style entertainers roamed the grounds, adding a sense of wonder and surprise throughout the event.

## Thoughtful Touches and Immersive Design

Guests had the chance to experience more than just the performances. There were henna and bindi stations, along with a range of astrologers and fortune readers—offering palm, tarot, and tea leaf readings. A photo booth featured hand-painted fabric backdrops, floral touches, and themed props. A serene Japanese tea garden provided a peaceful retreat from the high energy of the party, while a Buddha ice sculpture served as an elegant focal point.

## A Culinary Journey

The food, catered by McCall’s, matched the evening’s energy and theme. A wide variety of Asian cuisines were served across multiple stations and bars. From bold street-style dishes to refined classics, the offerings encouraged guests to explore, taste, and enjoy throughout the night.

## A Celebration to Remember

The combination of curated performances, immersive environments, and thoughtful details made this holiday party one of a kind. To this day, many attendees still say it was the best holiday celebration they’ve ever been to—and I’m proud to have helped bring it all to life.
