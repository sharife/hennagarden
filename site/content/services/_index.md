testimonials:
  - author: Deidre Kernan, California Academy of Science
    quote: We have used Renda Dabit and HennaGarden at the California Academy of
      Sciences’ Annual Black Tie Ball for several years.  They are
      fabulous!  Extremely professional, easy to work with, great costumes and
      ideas, great henna, face painting and crystal tattoos.  The guests love
      them.  I would recommend them to anyone for any event.
  - author: Tim Lynn, Salesforce.com
    quote: Everything was superb — the quality of the performers was wonderful — all
      60 of them!  I was particularly delighted with the cross-cultural variety
      of all the performers…Your people really made the difference between a
      good event and a memorable one.  You made it so easy and we will
      absolutely use Henna Garden again for our next big event!
