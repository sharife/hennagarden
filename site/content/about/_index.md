      From our beginnings as the first henna salon in the U.S. to becoming a
      leading event and entertainment agency with over 1,000 curated performers,
      Henna Garden has built a reputation for excellence, creativity, and
      authenticity. Our work is grounded in cultural richness, client care, and
      unforgettable experiences.


      Since 1996, Henna Garden Events & Entertainment has collaborated with clients across the Bay Area—from corporations and universities to cultural institutions and private celebrations. Our events are immersive, high-impact, and thoughtfully designed to engage and inspire.
       
      Whether we’re producing a full-scale festival or crafting intimate cultural activations, our approach is rooted in decades of experience and a deep love for the art of gathering.

      Renda Dabit launched Henna Garden with a mission to share the beauty and
      traditions of henna with the world. After founding the first dedicated
      henna salon in Berkeley in 1996, then expanding to LA and NYC in 1997,
      Renda quickly became a go-to creative for both private and public events,
      known for her authenticity, innovation, and warm presence.
       
      With over 29 years of experience in event planning and entertainment, Renda has grown Henna Garden into a trusted name for dynamic, inclusive, and culturally rich experiences. Her commitment to excellence, paired with a deep network of global talent, ensures that every event is as seamless as it is spectacular.
