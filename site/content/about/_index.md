      Renda Dabit, Founder and Director of Henna Garden Events and
      Entertainment, brings over 25 years of event planning experience.  After
      opening the first U.S. Henna Salon in 1996, Renda discovered and developed
      her talent for organized entertainment.  The success of her Henna Salon
      and her previous decade of experience as an events manager enabled her to
      launch her own event planning and entertainment firm.  What began as a
      boutique service in the San Francisco Bay Area expanded to Los Angeles and
      New York City/Tri-State area.  A meticulous professional with a
      spontaneous and bohemian spirit, Renda channels her creativity to make
      each event an innovative and exceptional experience.
